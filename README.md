This project was created for my Data Structures and Algorithms 2 class. 
The purpose of this project is to create an algorithm that automatically delivers packages and tracks the miles traveled by the trucks delivering the packages. 
A CLI was created for the user to check the miles traveled by the trucks or the delivery status of the packages at a given time.
This project could be further optimized; however, I met the class requirement that specified the project should run in polynomial time or better.
